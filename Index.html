                </legend>
                <p> &#128073; In HTML, for example, the &lt;h1&gt; element is a semantic element, which gives the text it
                    wrap around the role (or meaning) of " a top level heading on your page"</p>
                <p> &#9658; <mark> Here is a top level heading</mark> </p>
                <p> &#128073; By default, most browser's user agent stylesheet will style an &lt;h1&gt; with large font size
                    to make it look like a heading (although you could style it to look like anyting you wanted). On the
                    other hand, you could make any element look like a top level heading. </p>
                <p> &#9658;<mark> Consider the following</mark></p>
                <p> &#x21E8; This will render it to look like a top level heading, but it has no semantic value, so it will
                    not get any extra benefits as described above. It is therefore a good idea to use the right HTML element for
                    the right job.</p>
                <p> &#x21E8; HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated and not based on its default
                    presentation styling. Presentation (how it should look), is the sole responsibility of CSS.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Search engines will cansider its content as important keywords to influence the page's search
                        ranking (see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO">SEO</a>)</li>

                    <li>Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with
                        or without semantic or namespaced classes</li>
                    <li>Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated</li>
                    <li>Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming</li>

                <p> &#11088; <mark>SEO (Search Engine Optimezation)</mark> is the process of marking a website more visible
                    in
                    search result, also termed improving search rankings.</p>
                <p> &#11088; Search engines <strong>crawl</strong> the web, following links from to page to page, and index
                    the
                    content found.
                    When you search, the search engine displays the indexed content. Crawlers follow rules. If you
                    follow those rules closely when doing SEO for a website, you give the site the best chances of
                    showing up among the first, increasing traffic and possibly revenue <i>(for ecommerce and ads).</i></p>
                <p> &#11088; Search engines give some guidelines for SEO, but big search engines keep result ranking as a
                    trade secret, SEO combines official search engine guidelines, empirical knowledge from science papers or
                    patents.</p>
